# Multi-Path-Stories

This is a very simple add build on Node`@8.10.0` using MongoDB, Express and Handlebars and hosted on Heroku. In order to run the app locally you need to connect to instance of MongoDB and then serve the application by running `npm run start`.

I was aiming to reproduce the app as closely as possible. For that purpose I built a data model for Sentence and controllers, which enable data manupulation as per the design requirenments. I did not provide any additional functionality, which could have enforced a better design but this was in order to execute in a timely fashion. I though that this test is concerned with testing the following:

- using databases
- creating data models
- using custom routing

I think that a more successful design would take other opperations into account as well as performing some of the data manipulation on the front end.
